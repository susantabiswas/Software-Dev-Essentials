    Things to note:
    1. We need a fast way to find the kth element, brute force way is O(N), so
    it should be better than that.
    2. Elements need to put at the back efficiently

    
    SOLUTION 1: BINARY INDEXED TREE
    
    TC: O(log(T) * log(T))
    SC: O(T)

    where T = n + 2000 + 1, n = initial size of array

    To find out the kth element, we can use cummulative sum of elements. In the
    cummulative sum, each element contributes 1, i's not their value which is used
    for the sum, rather their frequency.
    Idea is to use binary search in the range of elements and for the nums[mid], 
    check if it's cummulative sum till that point is k.

    Once we move the element to the back, we need to update the cummulative sum as well.
    So we can use either a segment tree or binary indexed tree for this.
    Here in this solution a Binary Indexed tree is used. Initially we update the sum
    for 1..n. Then for each fetch, when we move the element to back, we do 2 update calls.
    One update(kth_idx, -1) which effectively removes contribution of kth element
    and the other update(last_idx, 1), adds 1 to signify a new element has been added at the
    back.
    
    SOLUTION 2: SQUARE ROOT DECOMPOSITION
    
    TC: O(sqrt(n))
    SC: O(n + sqrt(n))
    
    Idea is to create buckets of size sqrt(n) and then do search in two levels.
    1st search for the bucket where the element exists and then search in that bucket only.
    
    We store the iterator of starting element of each bucket.Then for the given k, get the 
    bucket idx by k = k / bucket_size.
    Then inside the bucket traverse will we get the kth element.
    Since element is removed, the subsequent buckets need to undergo change as well.
    Since we removed an element, each bucket now takes an element from right and hence
    the starting element of each bucket becomes the next element.
