    TC: O(N)
    SC: O(N), worst case: skewed tree
    
    Since the paths to check for start from top and continue from parent to
    child subtrees. So each path from parent A to a node in some nested subchild 
    B is basically a path which can have sum equivalent to req. sum. We can look
    at the problem as finding a subarray sum in an array which matches the given sum.
    SO to do that we start tracking all the sums seen during traversal from
    top to bottom and at each node also check if we found paths matching the req. sum.
