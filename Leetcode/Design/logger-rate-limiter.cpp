    Design a logger system that receives a stream of messages along with their timestamps. Each unique message should only be printed at most every 10 seconds (i.e. a message printed at timestamp t will prevent other identical messages from being printed until timestamp t + 10).

    All messages will come in chronological order. Several messages may arrive at the same timestamp.

    Implement the Logger class:

        Logger() Initializes the logger object.
        bool shouldPrintMessage(int timestamp, string message) Returns true if the message should be printed in the given timestamp, otherwise returns false.

    Example:

    Input
    ["Logger", "shouldPrintMessage", "shouldPrintMessage", "shouldPrintMessage", "shouldPrintMessage", "shouldPrintMessage", "shouldPrintMessage"]
    [[], [1, "foo"], [2, "bar"], [3, "foo"], [8, "bar"], [10, "foo"], [11, "foo"]]
    Output
    [null, true, true, false, false, false, true]

    Solution 1: Hash Table
    We use hash table to store the last printed message time for each of the unique messages. 
    TC: O(1)
    Cons: Memory exhaustion
    Pros: Simple to implement
    
    Solution 2: Two sets
    Idea is to keep two sets. Each set keeps track of one interval of 10s that is wrt to a start time.
    Set 1 keeps all the messages 10 seconds before start_time and set 2 keeps all the messages from start_time till 10s from there.
    For a given log, if the timestamp is in the curent interval, then check against that set.
    Else, the current set interval duration has elapsed and hence move the elements from that set
    to set1 because some elements might still have not completed 10s and hence we keep them safe in set1 for
    another 10s.
    
    Solution 3: Queue + Set
    Use a queue that records the log events. Idea is to have a queue that only stores the events from last 10s. We also use
    a set that keeps track of logs recently printed. For every new log message, remove the events from queue that are older than 10s.
    While removing ensure to remove the entries from set as well. Check if the message is still present or not in the set after removing.
    If it does, that means that log entry hasn't elapsed the 10s mark and still in queue. Add the event log if it is getting printed.
    
    Solution 4: Bucketing + Set
    Idea is to keep buckets for each of the 10s. We maintain an array that tracks the timestamp for a bucket. If use % operation to
    decide the bucket. If the timestamp of a bucket is not equal to current timestamp, that means it's been 10s since the last log message
    for that bucket, so clear all the messages from that bucket.
    Then check all the buckets for that same log message and one which is under 10s mark, if we find one then that means we don't print the
    current log message and hence ignore the message.
    If we don;t find any buckets with the message, add the message to the right bucket.
