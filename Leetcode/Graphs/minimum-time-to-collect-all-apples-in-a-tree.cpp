    We make a graph and do DFS to find finding the paths with apples. During DFS we find the
    total one way path length from root till the last apple in subtree. DFS returns whether there is a 
    apple in the current tree or not, if that is true, we include the the parent node to connect it with
    the subtree by adding +1.
