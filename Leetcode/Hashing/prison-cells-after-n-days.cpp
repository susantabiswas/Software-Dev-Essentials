    Since for binary bits, there can be 2^N combinations. So since only 6 places
    change, we have 2^6 combinations and for any N greater than that, we will see
    repeatition. The possible states can be thought of like values on a circle, so we start
    with the state after the initial as the starting point, since initial state can have
    1 in 1st or last position and because of the rules we will never get that state and 
    simulation won't end. 
    So when we again see a value which matches our first state, means we have covered the possible states
    and the answer is amongst them.
    so we use (N-1) % len(states). N-1 so that it matches the array index.
    
    TC: O(2^8)
